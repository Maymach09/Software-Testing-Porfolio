DevOps is CALMS:
    Culture
    Automation
    Lean - Agile Development, Cont. Improvement,
    Measurement - measuring KPI, acros entire lifecycle - time to deployment, recovery time, user trends
    Shraing - Sharing responsibility among teams

DEV:
    Plan --> Branch --> Code --> Build

OPS:
    Release --> Deploy --> Operate --> Monitor

Agile:
    Development
    Testing
    deployment

DevOps Pipleline/CICD Pipleline:
    Code
    Build
    Test
    Package
    Release
    Monitor
    Configure - Infrastructure as Code Tools

DevOps Principles:
    Build, test & Release
        - Continuos Testing
            - Test early & everywhere
            - Fail early

Test Strategy:
    - Deployment Pipleline
    - Pairing
    - Bug Bash
    - Feature Toggles
    - Crowdsourced Testing
    - Monitoring as Testing
    - A/B Testing
    - Beta Testing
    - Canary Release
    - Staged Rollout
    - Dogfooding
    - Dark Launching
    - Environment Management
    - Infra as code Testing
    - Destructive Testing

Testing in Development:
    - Deployment Pipeline:
            - Static Analysis
            - Functional and Non functional tests
            - Unit, integration and E2E tests
            - Deployment Scripts
            - Build Code
    - Feature Toggles
    - Bug Bash
    - Crowdsourced Testing

Testing in Production:
    - Feedback
    - A/B Testing
    - Beta Testing
    - Monitoring as Testing
    - Controlled exposure tets - Canary release, Dogfooding, staged rollout, Dark Launching

DevOps Testing - Best Practices:
    - Microservice Architecture
    - Automate where possible
    - Embrace Continuous
    - Documentation, metrics  

Feedback:
    - JIRA
