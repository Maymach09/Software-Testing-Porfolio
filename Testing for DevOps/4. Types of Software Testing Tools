Types of software testing tools

Automated Testing tools
    - Selenium
        - IDE - lightweight(prototype testing)
            - firefox or chrome add on
        - Webdriver (browser automation)
            - calls directly to the browsers
            - faster than IDE RC
            - Supports all browsers
        - Grid 
            - runs tests concurrently on different machines 
            - and different browsers
            - uses hub and nodes structure
    - Katalon Studio:
        - Simple deployment
        - Easy to configure and setup
        - Quick development and turn around time
        - Support for recording test macros
        - Full IDE allows complec scripts
    Pros and Cons:
        - No fees
        - Growing community
        -Dependent on Selenium
        - Limited language support - Java and Groovy
    Testing support:
        - API test types: Validation testing, Error detection testing, Functional Testing, Security Testing, Load Testing, Penetration testing
        - Mobile testing
